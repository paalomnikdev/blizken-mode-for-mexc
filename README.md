# Description
This is a simple Chrome extension that turns PNL values white on MEXC futures trading, inspired by Blizken.
Google is asking for $5 to publish the extension to the Chrome Store. I don't think I need to do this because it was created just for fun, so anyone can download the code and install it in their browser.

# How to install
1. Download the code [here](https://github.com/paalomnikdev/blizken-mode-for-mexc/releases)
2. Unpack it
3. Go to Chrome extensions: open new tab in Chrome, paste **chrome://extensions/** and hit Enter
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click **Load unpacked**
6. Select extension folder
7. Make sure extension is enabled
8. Refresh MEXC futures page

# How to update
1. Go to Chrome extensions: open new tab in Chrome, paste **chrome://extensions/** and hit Enter
2. Check developer mode is enabled
3. Remove existing extension
4. Follow instructions from installation section
